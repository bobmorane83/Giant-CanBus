Reverse engineering on my Giant Trance E+1 Pro 2019 eBike


I recently bought a used Giant Trance E+1 Pro 2019 eBike. That's my first eBike. Great bike BTW ;)
The motor is a Giant Syncdrive pro aka Yamaha PW-X. This motor (and it's battery) communicate with canbus.

I'am newbee on canbus, but this is a good way to play around with it and learn a lot !

My bike came with a ridecontrol One. This is fine, but I also bought a used Ridecontrol Evo with a large screen.
So I installed the Ridecontrol Evo on the bike and remain with the One unused. And guess what ? I opened it ... of course.
